# Accelerating-Parallel-Audio-Processing-with-GPU

CUDA C based real time parallel audio stream processing system.
Develop an equalization algorithm to equalize a given parallel audio
streams in real time. Optimizing the algorithm using NVIDIA Visual
Profiler. Evaluate performance between Intel Core i5 CPU and NVIDIA
GeForce GPU for a single audio sample processing algorithm. Evaluate
performance between different types of audio sampling rates and the
number of audio streams on selected GPUs.

Matlab files used to evaluate performance in CPU side. Two .wav files used to evaluate the algorithm is also included. (in .zip)

Single audio sample and parallel audio sample equalization CUDA C codes are included. (in separated .zip)

To further information refer "documentation.txt" file in each folder.
